      <h2>🎯 Core Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>📚 Academic Advocacy – Better notes flow, doubt sessions, reminder culture (no more last-minute chaos).</li>
        <li>📅 Organized Scheduling – No clashing tests, better event coordination, transparent timetables.</li>
        <li>🗣️ Faculty Coordination – Regular feedback to/from teachers, less shouting – more solving!</li>
        <li>🎤 Student Voice – Every concern matters. Real-time polls, feedback forms, and class meetings that aren’t boring!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>🎉 Beyond Books</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🎙️ Events & Fests – Open mics, quizzes, meme battles, chill zone events. Why should life be all theory?</li>
        <li>🤝 Team Building – Bonding activities that don't suck. From chai meets to CR cricket matches!</li>
        <li>📣 More Participation – Representing your talent in college-level stuff – cultural, tech, sports.</li>

        <li>📲 Real-Time Coordination – WhatsApp/Telegram group updates with emoji-coded urgency levels 😂</li>

      <h2>✨ What Makes Vinit Different?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Doesn’t overpromise. Delivers or at least dies trying 😅</li>
        <li>✅ Good rapport with teachers (yes, even the strict ones 👀)</li>
        <li>✅ Listens more than he speaks (unless chai is involved)</li>
        <li>✅ Mix of fun and responsibility – meme admin + class savior 💪</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🗳️ Why This Manifesto Matters</h2>
      <p>Because you deserve a CR who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💡 Brings ideas, not excuses</li>
        <li>📣 Talks less, does more</li>
        <li>☕ Takes chai breaks *after* solving issues</li>
        <li>🌟 Believes CR means “Class Rockstar” (in service, not selfies)</li>
      </ul>

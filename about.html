    <h2>Who is Vinit?</h2>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <img src="vinit.jpg" alt="Vinit - CR Candidate" 
       style="width: 250px; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 6px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
  <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #555;">"Vinit - Your CR with Vibe & Vision âœ¨"</p>
</div>

    
    <p>Vinit is not your average CR candidate. Heâ€™s a vibe, a movement, a chai-loving, attendance-bending, meme-sharing leader who believes in bringing real energy into class life. From motivating you at 8am lectures to saving your proxy at 11:30, heâ€™s always there with a solution (or at least a samosa).</p>

    <p>His story began in the dust and sparkle of Mining 1st Year â€“ navigating lectures, labs, and late-night group chats. Now in 2nd Year, Vinit wants to go from being "that helpful guy in group" to being the *official voice* of the class.</p>

    <p>Why? Because he believes CRs arenâ€™t bosses, theyâ€™re bridges â€“ between students and faculty, between problems and solutions, between stress and success.</p>

    <h2>Leadership Vibes</h2>
    <p>He leads with a laugh, manages with a meme, and communicates like a champ. Need help organizing something? Vinit will plan it, poster it, promote it â€“ all while checking if the canteen has Maggi.</p>

    <p>Heâ€™s the guy who:
      <ul>
        <li>Reminds you of deadlines before the teachers do.</li>
        <li>Fights for your attendance like a Supreme Court lawyer.</li>
        <li>Knows how to calm a group down during viva panic.</li>
        <li>Respects everyoneâ€™s opinion, even if it's just about which samosa chutney is better.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Vision as CR</h2>
    <p>His plan isnâ€™t just to sit in front benches after winning. Nope. He wants:
      <ul>
        <li>A class environment where fun and responsibility walk hand in hand.</li>
        <li>Faculty coordination that doesn't feel like a one-sided email.</li>
        <li>Activities that go beyond books â€“ quizzes, open mics, fests, debates.</li>
        <li>A support system â€“ emotional, academic, andâ€¦ attendance-wise.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Funny Facts</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Has cracked 20+ proxy codes â€“ all legalâ€¦ish.</li>
        <li>Believes chai is the answer to 90% of student issues.</li>
        <li>Has a meme folder organized semester-wise. Priorities!</li>
        <li>Once got a whole group assignment submitted with 30 mins to spare â€“ legend behavior.</li>
        <li>Gives free motivational speeches before internals (sponsored by stress).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>So, Why Vote Vinit?</h2>
    <p>Because Vinit wonâ€™t disappear after elections. Heâ€™ll be there â€“ in the chaos of submissions, in the joy of fests, in the tears of viva, and in the canteen during every break.</p>
    <p>Vote for the guy who brings real change, fun campaigns, and actual work behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>Vote for Vinit. Because CR hona chahiye â€“ relatable, reliable, and real. ðŸ’¯</p>
